                        <p> 
                            Developed a full stack enterprise Cloud solution on AWS using React.js that allows users to apply and receive federal/state licenses/permits via the Web.  All licenses and permits are created and stored on the back-end, using Java and PostgreSQL.
                            Working in an Agile/Scrum environment. 
                            Designed and refactored the code structure package to allow flexibility for future enhancements.
                            Integrated ELP with external APIs including Illinois Health Family Services, incorporating their required checklist for receiving licenses and permits.</p>

                            Utilized Java, Spring Framework, SOAP, and JDBC to develop enhancements for TPE, an enterprise payment system.
                            Integrated TPE with multiple card processing systems including Vantiv, First Data, and Worldpay.
                            Designed, created, and maintained services to process different types of payments including credit cards, PIN debit, EMV, and ACH (checks) while maintaining PCI compliance.</p>

                        <p>   
                          Rebuilt TPE using Java to implement a new flow, which elevated NIC from a state-only payment processor to processing Federal Government payments.
                          Implemented JPA, ORM/Eclipse-Link, and RESTful Web services to replace legacy systems.
                          Created RESTful APIs and documentation with Swagger to integrate internal and external services with TPE.
                          Developed stand-alone Spring Boot applications to aid integration testing of legacy functionality with the new TPE flow.
                          Increased unit test coverage from 7% to over 40%.</p>

                          Developed enhancements for Community Care Link (CCL), an enterprise application for behavior health records, assessments, and client billing.
                          Utilized ASP.NET MVC, SQL/T-SQL, and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to create behavioral health records, assessments, and client billing report.
                          Refactored code to improve performance and fix bugs.</p>
